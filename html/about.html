          <p id="about-me">I am a proud Kanaka, born and raised with the unique privilege of experiencing life on both the east and west sides, thanks to my journey as a foster child. Hawaii holds a special place in my heart as it represents my heritage, culture, and the spirit of Aloha that shapes who I am. My passion for programming ignited at the age of 13, but it wasn't until late 2019, just before the onset of COVID-19, that I pursued it as a career. My formal training began at Launch School, where I immersed myself in learning the fundamentals of programming. This comprehensive education has equipped me with the essential skills and knowledge needed to thrive as a developer. While the tech world in Hawaii isn't vast, it is constantly growing, especially with AI becoming one of the biggest market movers. I am proud to be part of this evolving tech landscape in Hawaii.</p>
